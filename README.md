# Object-Oriented Programming in Python Masterclass

This repository contains the code examples and exercises for the Object-Oriented Programming in Python Masterclass. Below is an overview of each file corresponding to the topics covered in the course.

- `basics.py`: Introduces the fundamental concepts of classes, instances, attributes, and methods in Python.
- `magicmethods.py`: Demonstrates the use of magic methods, including operator overloading and protocols.
- `inheritance.py`: Contains examples of single inheritance, showcasing how a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
- `slots.py`: A placeholder for the topic of slots, which will be covered later in the course to optimize memory usage.
- `dataclasses_and_enums.py`: Provides examples of dataclasses for automated attribute management and enums for enumerations.
- `multipleinheritance.py`: Explores the concept of multiple inheritance and mixin classes in Python.
- `getters_and_setters.py`: Illustrates the use of properties, getters, and setters for controlled attribute access.
- `deskriptors.py`: Covers both data and non-data descriptors for managing attribute access in a class.
- `abcs.py`: Implements abstract base classes to define a common API for a set of subclasses.
- `metaprogramming.py`: Discusses metaprogramming concepts for creating dynamic and flexible code.
- `pattern.py`: Examines various design patterns and how they can be implemented in Python.

Each file is a standalone module providing clear examples related to the topic it represents. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of object-oriented programming in Python.
